This was just something to mess around with whilst I was trying to get 
the hang of Openstack's Swift.

It allows you to fire up a medium AWS instance, put this script onto the 
instance, run the script, and have a working Swift setup in a minute
or two.

You can then run the script again to make it all happen again and again.
Trash the old cluster, make a new one.

Have fun!
